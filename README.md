# Cagebreak Archlinux Package

This repository provides PKGBUILDs for [cagebreak](https://github.com/project-repo/cagebreak).

All releases on master are tagged corresponding to the cagebreak release and signed.

For every release we provide a tarball containing at least `.SRCINFO` and `PKGBUILD`
and a corresponing signature.

We also provide these PKGBUILDs in the [AUR](aur.archlinux.org).

## Cagebreak

This pkgbuild is provided for those who want a full build from source.

## Cagebreak-bin

This pkgbuild simply extracts a precompiled binary and the man pages and therefore
requires no build dependencies (runtime dependencies are still required).

## cagebreak-arm

This aarch64 pkgbuild is not officially supported and not in the AUR.

## Signing Keys

The following keys are valid:

  * A9C386EFBEB0819C5523E6AB2AD89C95DEA1AE85
  * FC9B267D2C4AE25E139BADF5B093C3C73E9053A1
  * 7857F021E8808412DD6C2F8849B3AD1FFEA4AE42
  * EAB01D6E2206E0FE012F68EBA001D296F543C4EC

Note that the keys are signed by at least one signing key of the cagebreak project.
